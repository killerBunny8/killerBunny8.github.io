      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Muhammad, I am an ambitious computer science student hoping to experience and push technology to its limits. I am dedicated to expanding my own knowledge and enjoy using this knowledge to simplify and solve complex problems. I am extremely adaptable and can effectively reduce the impact of everchanging environment. I have experience working in teams as well as independently which boost my time management skills as well as communication skills and make me an efficient person.
       I would like to build on my strengths and work on refining my skills by taking on more difficult challenges. I have made a website for a small charity and would like to undertake more projects like this as it allows me to leave a positive impact while building a reputation within the community.
